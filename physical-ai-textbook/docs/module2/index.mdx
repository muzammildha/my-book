title: Digital Twin Simulation
---

### Overview
- Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical robots.
- Enable safe experimentation before deploying to hardware.

### Tools
- **Gazebo Simulator:** Open-source 3D robotics simulator.
- **Physics engines:** ODE, Bullet for realistic dynamics.

### Hands-On
- Create a simulated robot environment.
- Test locomotion algorithms virtually.
- Observe sensor outputs and refine control strategies.
