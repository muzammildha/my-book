title: Vision-Language-Action Systems
---

### Overview
- Integrates **computer vision**, **natural language understanding**, and **robotic actions**.
- Enables robots to interpret commands and act in real-time environments.

### Architecture
- **Perception:** Vision models detect objects and scene context.
- **Language:** NLP models parse instructions.
- **Action:** Decision-making system maps perception + language to robot actions.

### Hands-On
- Implement a simple pipeline: Camera input → NLP command → Actuator output.
- Test VLA system in simulation to perform simple tasks.
