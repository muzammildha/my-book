title: ROS 2 Fundamentals
---

### Overview
- ROS 2 is the next-generation Robot Operating System.
- Provides communication between nodes in distributed robotic systems.
- Supports real-time, multi-platform robotics applications.

### Key Concepts
- **Nodes:** Independent processes that perform computation.
- **Topics:** Publish/subscribe message system for inter-node communication.
- **Services:** Request-response messaging between nodes.
- **Actions:** Long-running tasks with feedback.

### Hands-On
- Create a simple ROS 2 node that publishes sensor data.
- Subscribe to the topic to control an actuator in simulation.
