# Capstone: Simple AI-Robot Pipeline

## Chapter 3: Capstone Project

### Objective
Build a **complete AI-robot pipeline** from perception to action.

### Steps
1. **Design the robot**: select sensors and actuators.
2. **Simulate movement**: walk, avoid obstacles, perform simple tasks.
3. **Integrate AI**: small ML model for decision-making.
4. **Test in simulation**: ensure end-to-end workflow.
5. **(Optional) Hardware deployment**: deploy code to a real robot if available.

### Example Project
- Task: Navigate a room, pick up an object, and place it in a target area.
- Skills applied: kinematics, perception, AI decision-making, ROS integration.

### Learning Outcomes
- Apply theory to practical robotics tasks.
- Understand AI-driven decision-making in physical systems.
- Gain experience with modular robotics programming and simulation.
