# Introduction to Physical AI


## Introduction

### Overview
Physical AI involves AI systems interacting with the **physical world**. Examples include humanoid robots, autonomous drones, and robotic arms.

Humanoid Robots are designed to **resemble human form and behavior**, with sensors, actuators, and intelligence integrated.

**Scope of this course:**
- From foundational principles to a working AI-driven humanoid robot pipeline.
- Focus on hands-on learning, simulation, and practical implementation.

**Objectives:**
- Understand AI and robotics concepts.
- Set up simulation environments.
- Implement AI-driven robot tasks.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Describe key concepts in Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
- Explain AI-robot system architecture.
- Conduct hands-on experiments in a simulated environment.
