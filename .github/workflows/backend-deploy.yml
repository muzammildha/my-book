      # This step is a placeholder. Real deployment to Railway/Render
      # would involve their specific CLI or GitHub Action integrations.
      # Example for Railway CLI:
      # - name: Deploy to Railway
      #   env:
      #     RAILWAY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
      #   run: railway up --service your-service-name

      # Example for Render (if using their native Git integration, this workflow might just trigger it):
      # - name: Trigger Render Deploy Hook
      #   env:
      #     RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK: ${{ secrets.RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL }}
      #   run: curl -X POST $RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK
